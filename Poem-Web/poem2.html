        <h1>“Still I Rise” <br /><em>by Maya Angelou</em></h1>

        <p class="p2">
          You may write me down in history <br /><br />

          With your bitter, twisted lies, <br /><br />

          You may tread me in the very dirt<br /><br />

          But still, like dust, I’ll rise.<br /><br />

          Does my sassiness upset you?<br /><br />

          Why are you beset with gloom?<br /><br />

          ’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells<br /><br />

          Pumping in my living room.<br /><br />

          Just like moons and like suns,<br /><br />

          With the certainty of tides,<br /><br />

          Just like hopes springing high,<br /><br />

          Still I’ll rise.<br /><br />

          Did you want to see me broken?<br /><br />

          Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br /><br />

          Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br /><br />

          Weakened by my soulful cries.<br /><br />

          Does my haughtiness offend you?<br /><br />

          Don’t you take it awful hard<br /><br />

          ’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines<br /><br />

          Diggin’ in my own back yard.<br /><br />

          You may shoot me with your words,<br /><br />

          You may cut me with your eyes,<br /><br />

          You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br /><br />

          But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br /><br />

          Does my sexiness upset you?<br /><br />

          Does it come as a surprise<br /><br />

          That I dance like I’ve got diamonds<br /><br />

          At the meeting of my thighs?<br /><br />

          Out of the huts of history’s shame<br /><br />

          I rise<br /><br />

          Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br /><br />

          I rise<br /><br />

          I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br /><br />

          Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br /><br />

          Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br /><br />

          I rise<br /><br />

          Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br /><br />

          I rise<br /><br />

          Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br /><br />

          I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br /><br />

          I rise<br /><br />

          I rise<br /><br />

          I rise.
