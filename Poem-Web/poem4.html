        <h1>"If You Forget Me" <br /><em> by Pablo Neruda </em></h1>

        <p class="p4">
          want you to know <br /> <br>

          one thing.<br /><br>

          You know how this is:<br /><br>

          if I look<br /><br>

          at the crystal moon, at the red branch<br /><br>

          of the slow autumn at my window,<br /><br>

          if I touch<br /><br>

          near the fire<br /><br>

          the impalpable ash<br /><br>

          or the wrinkled body of the log,<br /><br>

          <br /><br>
          everything carries me to you,
          <br /><br>

          as if everything that exists,
          <br /><br>

          aromas, light, metals,
          <br />
          <br>
          were little boats
          <br /><br>

          that sail
          <br /><br>

          <br /><br>
          toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

          <br /><br>
          Well, now,

          <br /><br>
          if little by little you stop loving me

          <br /><br>
          I shall stop loving you little by little.

          <br /><br>
          If suddenly
          <br>
          <br />
          you forget me
          <br>
          <br />
          do not look for me,
          <br>
          <br />
          for I shall already have forgotten you.

          <br /><br>
          If you think it long and mad,

          <br /><br>
          the wind of banners

          <br /><br>
          that passes through my life,

          <br /><br>
          and you decide

          <br /><br>
          to leave me at the shore

          <br /><br>
          of the heart where I have roots,

          <br /><br>
          remember
          <br>
          <br />
          that on that day,

          <br /><br>
          at that hour,

          <br /><br>
          I shall lift my arms

          <br /><br>
          and my roots will set off

          <br /><br>
          to seek another land.

          <br /><br>
          But

          <br /><br>
          if each day,

          <br /><br>
          each hour,

          <br /><br>
          you feel that you are destined for me

          <br /><br>
          with implacable sweetness,

          <br /><br>
          if each day a flower

          <br /><br>
          climbs up to your lips to seek me,

          <br /><br>
          ah my love, ah my own,

          <br /><br>
          in me all that fire is repeated,

          <br /><br>
          in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,

          <br /><br>
          my love feeds on your love, beloved, and as long as you live it will
          be in your arms <br /><br>

          without leaving mine.
